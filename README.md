# RestoreWin10Icons

This script will give the user the option to restore windows 10 icons on windows 11

The script will make a copy of the current icon file, if this one is the windows 10 version then you will want to use the included file to revert changes

KNOWN BUG:
Folders that contain an image or thumbnail the preview icon will remain in win 11 style making it look weird
